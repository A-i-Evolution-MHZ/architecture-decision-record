Subject:License question for Architecture Decision Records
Date:Monday, September 08, 2025 06:39

Hello, I'm seeking your copyright/permission person or team please. I'm an individual who maintains an education resource that includes one of your magazine articles, I'm seeking your guidance please on how to ask for permission to use the information and how to credit it the way your authors wish.

The education resource is a summary introduction called "Architecture Decision Record" and it gathers a dozen or so architecture decision record templates into one place. The intended audience is software developers such as myself. There's no profit of any kind. The purpose is to help discussions among software developer peers.

The project URL is:

https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/

The item by your authors is:

https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-jeff-tyree-and-art-akerman

What are options for next steps please?

Best,
Joel
